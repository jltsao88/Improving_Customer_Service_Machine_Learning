Using machine learning to predict finanical firms response to consumer complaints.

To decide whether a complaint is handle in an ‘appropriate’ manner I will use whether the complaint was handled in a
 
timely manner or not as a predictor.  I use appropriate in quotes because the term ‘appropriate’ can be ambiguous but
 
I assume it means that the complaint was handled as efficiently as it could.  Not responding in time could mean the
 
complaint was not resolved, difficult to handle, or maybe ignored due to lack of concern about the customer’s complaint.
